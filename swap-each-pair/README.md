# Swap Each Pair

(From a prompt in the 2022-08-08 cassidoo.email.)

## Description

Given a list, swap every two adjacent nodes. Something to think about: How would your code change if this were a linked list, versus an array?

### Example

```js
> swapPairs([1,2,3,4])
> [2,1,4,3]

> swapPairs([])
> []
```

## Notes

This is such a simple thing that I'm going to just try to do it fast while still adhering to TDD.

(3 minutes, apparently.)
